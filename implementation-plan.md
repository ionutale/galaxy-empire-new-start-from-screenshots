#### PostgreSQL Triggers and Hooks
**Status:** Not implemented (but available for future enhancements)

PostgreSQL does not support "hooks" in the traditional sense (like application-level event hooks in frameworks such as Rails or Django). However, it provides **triggers** and **event triggers**, which serve a similar purpose by allowing automatic execution of functions in response to database events. These can be considered database-level "hooks" for enforcing business logic, validation, auditing, and automation.

**1. Does PostgreSQL Support Hooks?**
- **No, not directly.** PostgreSQL doesn't use the term "hooks," but it has a robust trigger system that achieves similar functionality.
- **Triggers** (Chapter 37 in PostgreSQL docs): These are functions automatically executed when specific Data Manipulation Language (DML) events occur on tables, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. They can run before or after the event and can modify data or raise errors.
  - Example: A trigger could automatically update a player's points when their resources change.
- **Event Triggers** (Chapter 38 in PostgreSQL docs): These are global triggers that respond to Data Definition Language (DDL) events, such as `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP INDEX`, or `ALTER FUNCTION`. They are database-wide and useful for auditing schema changes or enforcing policies.
- Triggers are written in procedural languages like PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, or C, and are attached to specific tables or the database.
- In summary, while not called "hooks," PostgreSQL's trigger system provides hook-like behavior for database events.

**2. Does PostgreSQL Have Extensions or Plugins for Hooks?**
- **Yes, to some extent.** PostgreSQL has a rich ecosystem of extensions that can extend or enhance trigger-like functionality. However, most "hook" needs are covered by built-in triggers and event triggers. Here are relevant options:
  - **pg_event_trigger** (built-in): Extends event triggers for more granular DDL monitoring (e.g., tracking all schema changes).
  - **pg_cron**: An extension for scheduling recurring tasks (like cron jobs). It can be combined with triggers to create "hook-like" automation, such as running cleanup procedures periodically.
  - **pg_notify/listen**: Built-in functionality for asynchronous notifications. You can use triggers to send notifications (via `pg_notify`) to applications, effectively creating event-driven "hooks" that notify external systems (e.g., a Node.js app) when database changes occur.
  - **Third-party extensions**:
    - **pg_repack** or **pg_partman**: For automated table maintenance, which can be triggered by events.
    - **TimescaleDB** (for time-series data): Includes hooks for data retention and aggregation, triggered by time-based events.
    - **Custom extensions**: You can write your own C extensions to create specialized hooks, but this is advanced and requires deep PostgreSQL knowledge.
  - **No direct "hooks" extension**: There's no single extension called "hooks," but the combination of triggers, event triggers, and extensions like `pg_notify` or `pg_cron` can replicate hook functionality.
  - If you need more advanced event-driven behavior (e.g., webhooks to external APIs), you'd typically combine PostgreSQL triggers with application-level code or tools like Apache Kafka for event streaming.

**3. Can We Use Them to Improve Architecture, Design, and Performance?**
- **Yes, absolutely.** PostgreSQL triggers and related extensions can significantly enhance your application's architecture, design, and performance, especially for a game like Galaxy Empire where real-time data consistency and automation are critical. Here's how, with examples from your project:

**Architectural Improvements:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Move business logic (e.g., validation, calculations) from the application layer (SvelteKit/Node.js) to the database. This reduces application code complexity and makes the system more modular. For example:
  - Instead of validating building costs in TypeScript, use a trigger to enforce rules directly in the database.
- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: Triggers ensure rules are always enforced, even if multiple applications access the database. This prevents bugs from inconsistent application logic.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Use `pg_notify` with triggers to create a pub/sub system. For instance, when a fleet arrives, a trigger can notify the game server to update the UI in real-time, improving responsiveness without polling.

**Design Improvements:**
- **Automated Workflows**: Triggers can automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual code. In Galaxy Empire:
  - A trigger on the `building_queue` table could automatically process completed buildings and update planet resources, eliminating the need for application-side polling.
  - Event triggers could log all DDL changes (e.g., new tables for expansions) for auditing.
- **Scalability**: Offload computations to the database. For example, use triggers to calculate player points or resource production in real-time, reducing API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Triggers can raise exceptions for invalid data (e.g., preventing negative resources), providing immediate feedback.

**Performance Improvements:**
- **Reduced Network Overhead**: By processing logic in the database, you minimize data transfers between the app and DB. For Galaxy Empire's game tick system, triggers could handle resource updates without round-trips.
- **Caching and Indexing**: Triggers can maintain derived data (e.g., pre-computed rankings) in separate tables, speeding up queries.
- **Concurrency**: Triggers run in the same transaction as the triggering event, ensuring atomicity. This is better than application-side logic, which might lead to race conditions.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Extensions like `pg_cron` can schedule maintenance (e.g., cleaning old messages) without application intervention, freeing up resources.

**Practical Application to Galaxy Empire:**
In your current setup, you've already migrated much logic to stored procedures (e.g., `process_completed_ship_construction`). You could enhance this with triggers:
- **Example Trigger**: Add a trigger on `planet_resources` to automatically recalculate energy balance when buildings change, ensuring real-time accuracy.
- **Performance Boost**: Use `pg_notify` triggers to push updates to the SvelteKit app via WebSockets, replacing polling for better real-time performance.
- **Architecture Refinement**: Implement event triggers to audit game events (e.g., log all fleet dispatches), improving debugging and analytics.

**Potential Drawbacks and Considerations:**
- **Complexity**: Triggers can make debugging harder (e.g., cascading effects). Test thoroughly.
- **Performance Cost**: Heavy triggers might slow writes; monitor with `pg_stat_statements`.
- **Maintenance**: Ensure triggers are version-controlled with your migrations.
- **Alternatives**: If triggers aren't sufficient, consider application-level hooks (e.g., in SvelteKit) or external tools like Debezium for CDC (Change Data Capture).
