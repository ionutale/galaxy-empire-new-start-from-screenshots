# Game Description: Galaxy Empire Strategy Game

## Overview

This is a sci-fi strategy MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game played on mobile devices. The game focuses on base building, resource management, fleet construction, and galactic exploration/conquest. Players assume the role of a commander or emperor of a planetary colony, tasked with expanding their influence across the galaxy.

## Core Concept

The game combines classic 4X strategy elements (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) with mobile-friendly mechanics. Players start with a home planet, build infrastructure to gather resources (Metal, Gas, Crystal, Energy), research technologies, and build fleets of spaceships. The ultimate goal is to grow from a single planet to a powerful galactic empire, interacting with other players through alliances, trade, or warfare.

## Visual Style

The game features a 2.5D isometric art style for the planetary base view, with detailed, futuristic industrial structures. The galactic and system views use a deep space aesthetic with nebulae, stars, and planets rendered in a semi-realistic style. The UI is heavy on "sci-fi blue" tones, holographic effects, and metallic borders, evoking a high-tech atmosphere.

## Key Gameplay Loops

1.  **Base Development:** Constructing and upgrading buildings (Mines, Solar Plants, Shipyards, Research Labs) to increase production and capabilities.
2.  **Resource Management:** Balancing the inflow and outflow of Metal, Crystal, Gas, and Energy to sustain growth.
3.  **Fleet Management:** Building various classes of ships for defense, gathering, and attacking other players or NPCs.
4.  **Exploration:** Navigating through Galaxy, System, and Planet views to find new targets for colonization or raiding.
