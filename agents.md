## Always run code checks

To ensure code quality and consistency, always run the following checks before committing your code:

- **Prettier**: Use Prettier to format your code.
- **Linting**: Use ESLint to check for code style and potential errors.
- **Type Checking**: Use TypeScript to verify type correctness.
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier to maintain consistent code formatting.

**ALways focus on the code quality and readability, not just on making it work.**

Example commands:

```bash
pnpm run prettier
pnpm run lint
pnpm run check
pnpm run format
```
