## Always run code checks

To ensure code quality and consistency, always run the following checks before committing your code:
- **Linting**: Use ESLint to check for code style and potential errors.
- **Type Checking**: Use TypeScript to verify type correctness.

Example commands:
```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run  check
pnpm run format
```
