# Game Features

## 1. Resource System

The economy is driven by four primary resources, displayed prominently in the UI:

- **Metal:** Basic building material for structures and ships.
- **Crystal:** Advanced material for research and high-tech components.
- **Gas (Deuterium/Hydrogen):** Fuel for fleets and resource for specific research.
- **Energy:** Power required to run buildings; produced by Solar Plants.
- **Dark Matter/Premium Currency:** (Indicated by the purple icon) Used for speed-ups or premium items.

## 2. Planetary Base Building

Players manage a grid-less but spatial planetary surface where they place and upgrade structures:
